## Next Steps

1. **Open the "REVIEW NEEDED" images** in Finder:
   ```bash
   open /Users/stevenresman/Projects/physica-medica/lora-workflow/training-images/
   ```

2. **For each image, ask yourself:**
   - Is Dr. Maks' face clearly visible?
   - Is it a real photo (not a diagram/illustration)?
   - Does it show him at different angles/lighting than other photos?

3. **Tell me which images to keep** from the "REVIEW NEEDED" sections

4. **Goal:** 15-25 clear photos of Dr. Maks' face
