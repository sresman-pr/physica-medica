      <div class="legal-content">
        <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing and using the Physica Medica website (physicamedica.net), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our website.</p>

        <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
        <div class="disclaimer-box">
          <p><strong>Important:</strong> The information provided on this website is for general informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>No Doctor-Patient Relationship</h2>
        <p>Use of this website does not create a doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship between you and Physica Medica or Dr. Maksim Birikov. A professional relationship is only established when you become a patient of our clinic through the proper intake and consent processes.</p>

        <h2>Website Content</h2>
        <p>The content on this website, including text, graphics, images, and other material, is provided for informational purposes only.

        <h3>Arrival Time</h3>

        <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
        <p>Payment is due at the time of service. We accept cash, credit cards, HSA, and FSA payments.</p>
        <p>Physica Medica operates as an out-of-network provider for most insurance plans. We will provide you with a superbill (detailed receipt) that you can submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement.
