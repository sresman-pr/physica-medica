Using a patented device developed in Italy, this technique works with your body's natural muscle chains and fascial connections to restore proper alignment and eliminate chronic pain.</p>

      <h2>How Physica Medica is Different</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive postural assessment</li>
        <li>Customized treatment addressing your unique imbalances</li>
        <li>Education on maintaining proper alignment</li>
        <li>Steady communication and plan adjustments based on your progress</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Benefits Most</h2>
      <p>Pancafit is particularly effective for Baltimore residents experiencing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chronic back or neck pain from desk work</li>
        <li>Postural imbalances from repetitive movements</li>
        <li>Athletes seeking performance optimization</li>
        <li>Anyone looking to improve body aesthetics through better posture</li>
        <li>Post-pregnancy postural recovery</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Treatment Process</h2>
      <p>Each Pancafit session at Physica Medica follows a structured approach:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Comprehensive postural and movement analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Stretching:</strong> Guided exercises on the Pancafit device addressing your specific muscle chains</li>
        <li><strong>Integration:</strong> Functional movements to reinforce new postural patterns</li>
        <li><strong>Home Program:</strong> Customized exercises to maintain improvements between sessions</li>
