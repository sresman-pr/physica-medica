  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Can I make it to an appointment during my lunch break from downtown?",
      answer: "Yes! Our clinic is about 8 minutes from the Inner Harbor area. With a 60-minute appointment, you can comfortably fit treatment into an extended lunch. Many of our downtown patients schedule mid-day appointments."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there public transit access to your clinic?",
      answer: "The Charm City Circulator Purple Route runs between the Inner Harbor and Fells Point, stopping near our clinic. You can also take the water taxi from the Inner Harbor to Fells Point in the warmer months. Of course, parking is also easy in Fells Point."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer early morning appointments for downtown workers?",
      answer: "Yes, we offer appointments starting at 8:00 AM on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Many downtown workers prefer early appointments before heading to the office."
    },
    {
      question: "I sit at a desk all day and my back is always sore. Can you help?",
      answer: "Absolutely—this is one of the most common issues we treat. Prolonged sitting causes predictable problems: tight hip flexors, weak glutes, forward head posture, and upper back tension. Dr. Maks will assess your specific patterns and provide treatment plus exercises you can do at your desk to counteract these effects."

  neighborhoodInfo: `<p>The Inner Harbor area is Baltimore's commercial heart, home to thousands of office workers, hotel employees, and tourism industry professionals. From the towers along Pratt Street to the World Trade Center to the Convention Center, this is where Baltimore does business.</p>
  
  <p>The demands of downtown work take a toll on the body. Hours spent at desks create chronic postural problems. Long commutes add lower back strain. The stress of high-pressure jobs manifests as tension headaches and muscle tightness. For hospitality workers, the physical demands are different but equally challenging—long shifts on your feet, repetitive motions, and irregular schedules.</p>
  
  <p>Physica Medica is ideally located just 8 minutes from the Inner Harbor, making it easy for downtown workers to access quality physical therapy without fighting traffic across the city. Our flexible scheduling—including early morning and lunch appointments—fits the demanding schedules of Inner Harbor professionals.</p>
  
  <p>What sets us apart is the quality of care. While there are corporate PT clinics scattered throughout downtown, they typically offer rushed, impersonal sessions. At Physica Medica, you get 60 focused minutes with Dr. Maks every visit. For busy professionals who value their time and want real results, this boutique approach delivers where assembly-line PT fails.</p>`
