    {
      question: "Do you accept insurance for Canton patients?",
      answer: "We operate as an out-of-network provider, which means you pay at the time of service and we provide you with a superbill to submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Many patients find this model worthwhile for the quality and duration of care they receive."

  neighborhoodInfo: `<p>Canton has transformed from a working-class waterfront neighborhood into one of Baltimore's most desirable communities for young professionals and families. The Canton Waterfront Park and Promenade draw runners, cyclists, and dog walkers year-round, while Canton Square anchors a vibrant dining and shopping scene.</p>
  
  <p>This active lifestyle is exactly why Canton residents need access to quality physical therapy. The runners logging miles on the promenade, the CrossFit enthusiasts pushing their limits, the parents chasing kids around Patterson Park—all put demands on their bodies that can lead to injury or chronic pain.</p>
  
  <p>While there are chain PT clinics closer to Canton, many residents make the short drive to Physica Medica because they value quality over convenience. Our 60-minute one-on-one sessions provide the thorough assessment and hands-on treatment that 15-minute insurance-mill appointments simply cannot match.</p>
  
  <p>Dr. Maks understands the Canton lifestyle and tailors treatment to help you get back to running the waterfront, crushing workouts, and enjoying everything this amazing neighborhood has to offer.</p>`
