  neighborhoodInfo: `<p>Highlandtown is one of Baltimore's most authentic neighborhoods—a place where working families have lived for generations, where small businesses line Eastern Avenue, and where a thriving arts scene has taken root around the Creative Alliance. It's a diverse, tight-knit community that values hard work and genuine connection.</p>
  
  <p>Highlandtown residents often work physically demanding jobs. Construction, restaurant kitchens, warehouses, retail—these jobs take a toll on the body. Add in the artists and makers who spend hours in studios, and you have a community with real physical therapy needs.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, healthcare options in the area haven't always served Highlandtown well. Corporate clinics offer rushed, impersonal care. Wait times are long. Language barriers can be an issue. Many residents simply live with pain because the healthcare system feels inaccessible.</p>
  
  <p>Physica Medica is different. Just 5 minutes from Highlandtown, we offer the kind of personal, thorough care that everyone deserves. Dr. Maks takes time to understand your specific situation—your work demands, your pain patterns, your goals. You get 60 full minutes of treatment, not a rushed 15-minute session.</p>
  
  <p>The working people of Highlandtown deserve quality healthcare. Whether you're dealing with a job-related injury, chronic pain from years of physical work, or the repetitive strain of artistic practice, we're here to help—right in your neighboring community.</p>`
