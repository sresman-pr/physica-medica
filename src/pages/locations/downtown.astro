  neighborhoodInfo: `<p>Downtown Baltimore is the region's professional center—home to law firms on Charles Street, government offices at State Center and City Hall, corporate headquarters, and thousands of workers who spend their days in office towers. It's a place of demanding careers, long hours, and high stress.</p>
  
  <p>The physical toll of downtown professional life is significant. Desk work creates chronic postural problems. Stress manifests as tension headaches and jaw pain. Long commutes compound the damage. Many downtown workers live with chronic pain, assuming it's just part of the job.</p>
  
  <p>It doesn't have to be. Physica Medica is just 8 minutes from downtown, making it easy to access quality physical therapy during lunch, before work, or on your way home. Dr. Maks specializes in treating the specific issues that affect desk-bound professionals: forward head posture, thoracic spine stiffness, hip flexor tightness, and the chronic tension that comes from high-stress work.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike corporate PT clinics where you're rushed through 15-minute sessions, we provide 60 minutes of focused treatment every visit. This allows Dr. Maks to address not just your symptoms, but the underlying patterns that create them. Downtown professionals who value efficiency will appreciate our approach: real results in fewer visits, not endless sessions that maintain the status quo.</p>
  
  <p>Your career demands peak performance. Don't let chronic pain hold you back. The short trip to Fells Point can transform how you feel at work—and in life.</p>`
