      question: "Is there parking available near your Fells Point clinic?",
      answer: "Yes! Street parking is available on Bond Street and surrounding blocks. There's also a parking garage on Fleet Street, about a 2-minute walk from our clinic. Many of our Fells Point patients simply walk to their appointments."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer early morning or evening appointments for hospitality workers?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We understand that Fells Point's hospitality industry has unique schedules. We offer appointments starting at 8:00 AM and as late as 7:30 PM on certain days to accommodate servers, bartenders, and other service industry professionals."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with injuries from walking on cobblestones?",
      answer: "Yes, this is actually a common issue we treat! The beautiful cobblestone streets of Fells Point can cause ankle sprains, aggravate plantar fasciitis, and create chronic instability. Dr. Maks can assess your gait, provide treatment, and recommend footwear strategies for navigating these historic streets safely."
    },
    {
      question: "How is your clinic different from the chain PT clinics?",
      answer: "At Physica Medica, you get 60 full minutes of one-on-one care with Dr. Maks—not 15 minutes split between multiple patients with rotating therapists. This boutique approach means faster results and a treatment plan truly customized to your needs and lifestyle."
